# Email-phone-extracter

This is my first project and im sharing cause why not. Its simple and can be useful to some. So ill keep it that way unless it somehow becomes a project and good amount of people use. 


So if you have any suggestions or critism please let me know ! thanks !


A very simple python tool that can read various file types and extract all the phone numbers and emails. 

It prints the path to all files as well so you wont have trouble finding extracted information 





Go to directory where you downloaded the script  
python3 Extracter.py
everything else is self explanatory as you will be prompted 


-V or --verbose for verbose mode (i only suggest using when scanning over around 60k emails/phone numbers to be sure script is working correctly)

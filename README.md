# Email-phone-extracter
A very simple python tool that can read various file types and extract all the phone numbers and emails. 
It prints the path to all files as well so you wont have trouble finding extracted information 





Go to directory where you downloaded the script  
python3 Extracter.py
everything else is self explanatory as you will be prompted 


-V or --verbose for verbose mode (i only suggest using when scanning over around 60k emails/phone numbers to be sure script is working correctly)
